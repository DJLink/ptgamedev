**Notes**

> This list was born because I thought it would be nice to have a one place landing page with links and resources that can be useful for anyone working in game development in Portugal, or moving here and wants to get in touch with the community, conferences and meets.
> There are several places and groups, sometimes when I mention that a Facebook group exists some get surprised. So by sharing this link, that anyone can contribute I hope this makes it easier. Maybe in the future we'll have a list of gamedev meets in every city in the country.

> Why make this page in English if this is for the PT Community?
> No particular reason but I think it makes it easier to share with a developer visiting the country and wanting to know the community.
