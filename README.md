# Tech!

#### Todos

 - Add Local Game Meets
 - Add more development focused events (or that usually has a GameDev component)
 - (?)Add a tech section maybe with links to good resources, such as articles, forums or Youtube channels, international or otherwise  

**Notes**

> This list was born because I thought it would be nice to have a one place landing page with links and resources that can be useful for anyone working in game development in Portugal, or moving here. The idea is that anyone thinking in starting game development, join the community or simply just chat online to quickly find other developers, conferences and meets.
> There are several places and groups, sometimes when I mention that a Facebook group exists some people get surprised, so I thought it would be cool to have a landing page that is quick to edit and anyone can contribute with a pull request. I hope in the future we can have a list of gamedev meets listed by cities.

> Why make this page in English if this is for the PT Community?
> No particular reason but I think it makes it easier to share with a developer visiting the country and wanting to know the community.
